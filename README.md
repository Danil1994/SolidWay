Task for SolidWay company.

Create model which present some data.
And configurate all necessary setting to show some date from DB on the web page.

When you load this project, install all requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Use existing migrations 'python manage.py migrate'

If you wish you may create fake data from create_fake_data.py

Use 'python manage.py runserver' command and open the link 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/
' to see result of work.

Also model has registered on the admin panel? so you may create superuser and add some date yourself.
